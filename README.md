"# intracranial_ephys_utils" 
To get this up and running, you're gonna want to set up a conda environment using the environment.yml file in this repo. Don't forget to activate the environment when you want to use this environment! Following that, git clone this repository wherever you want it to be. Finally, run pip install -e . while in the directory where this readme file is.
Then you should be able to import any of these functions into your own workflow. Most of the codes for this are built around neuralynx files, and specifically depth electrodes with some microwires. I think some things might work independently of this, and other things won't so feel free to comment any issues that come up, or bug me if you don't understand and I'll add better documentation. Most of my docs exist for me to know what input output objects (shapes etc).
