## About

This project serves to be a starting point for sEEG, iEEG, and microwire LFP analyses in human neuroscience datasets.
Importantly, this projects builds heavily off of neo to do I/O, and ephyviewer to manually annotate or curate event times,
such as epileptiform activity, or task relevant variables.

If there's anything you'd like to see this code do, please add an issue on github, or email me directly about it at
